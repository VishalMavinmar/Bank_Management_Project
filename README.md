# Bank_Management_Project
A Bank Management System built by me using Java, designed to simulate core banking operations such as customer registration, login authentication, balance inquiry, deposit,personal data update  and transaction history. The system follows an MVC architecture using JSP, Servlets, and Oracle SQL for backend storage and processing.
